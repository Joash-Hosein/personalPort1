# TODO: Adjust Tailwind CSS on Navbar in Layout for Responsive Design

- [x] Fix typos in Tailwind classes (e.g., max-w-8x2 to max-w-7xl)
- [x] Make the header full-width and responsive by updating className
- [x] Adjust the nav to stack vertically on mobile with proper spacing (flex-col on small screens)
- [x] Tweak link padding for better mobile fit (reduce px on small screens)
